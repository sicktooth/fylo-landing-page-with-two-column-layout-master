### What I learned

I learnt how to modify svg images, like the hover effect the width modification which is tricky and different from regular images.. width units used to make svg responsive is % while images are vw and %

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
.intro__image {
    width: 80%;
}
#main__footer {
    grid-template-areas: 
        'head head head head'
        'contact nav docs social'
    ;
}
```

### Continued development

I want to focus on more tricks in hover effects, svg images and javascript.
